# cabinet-lister

Program :computer: for a local furniture :hammer: :convenience_store: store, that generates a list of all the parts needed to build a specific cabinets, based on customer input. To work it needs two csv files with list of cabinet. I didn't add this because of sensitivity :lock: of data.
